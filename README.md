# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# ListManager
This to-do list web application was developed step-by-step by following a guided React tutorial available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RWsLmu8yVc. The project demonstrates core React concepts such as components, state, and event handling.
